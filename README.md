# Procedural Drawing Projects in MATLAB

This repository contains three MATLAB scripts demonstrating different levels of procedural drawing techniques for letters using pixel manipulation on images.

---

## 1. Procedural-Drawing-of-Letters-in-MATLAB

A simple script that creates grayscale drawings of letters on a black background by directly manipulating pixel values in a 2D image matrix.  
This example focuses on basic image creation and drawing shapes with varying shades of gray.

## 2. Procedural-Color-Drawing-of-Letters-in-MATLAB

This script extends the previous example by creating color images using RGB channels.  
Letters are drawn using single colors (e.g., blue or green), showcasing how to manipulate each color channel separately in a 3D image matrix.

## 3. Procedural-Colorful-Drawing-of-Letters-in-MATLAB

An advanced version that draws letters using multiple distinct colors and additional decorative elements like colored dots.  
This demonstrates combining multiple colors and shapes in one image by assigning pixel values across RGB channels precisely.

# How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the desired `.m` script file in MATLAB.
3. Run the script. A figure window will display the resulting image with the drawn letters.
4. You can modify the parameters within the scripts to change colors, positions, and sizes.

# Important Notes

- These projects were created as part of a personal assignment and are not meant to be copied or reused without permission.
- The code is written to demonstrate procedural image drawing concepts and can be extended or adapted for other creative coding tasks.
- MATLAB R2016b or later is recommended for full compatibility with image display functions.
